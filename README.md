# Calculator

Final project in the foundations course. Lots of interesting logic to figure out, working with arrays and the associated functions. 

-- What worked well?

  -Rewriting everything using arrays. Initially started the project by defining variables as strings/numbers which made things very complicated and lots of fixing and rewriting code in various parts of the code required, to make things work. Eventually, each addition of logic created so many additional issues that needed fixing that I had to rewrite the whole thing almost from scratch, but using arrays. This was good for various reasons. Because I had already written most of the logic out initially, this made things easier know 'what i want to happen' with each section, so it was more of a case of figuring out how to apply the correct data types and methods. As well as this, it hopefully meant that my code was more efficient and readable. 
  
- It was also helpful to try to use functions where possible, to reuse in other sections of the code. I initially found it quite hard to 'seperate' functions so that each one only does one thing, as when things are working together (like display, calculation, holder variables etc) , it became quite hard to know which part specifically should be doing what and felt like all functions were in some ways connected, which led to adding lots of code to one function, which then couldn't be as easily reusable. On the second attempt, I was able to seperate these tasks a bit more effectively, once I understood a bit more how the calculator 'should' work because I had gone through the logic when using strings/numbers. Overall, I'm really glad I scratched everything I had and rewritten it, as I now feel more proud of the code (I'm sure it's still not neat to the knowledgable but huge improvement from before) and it most likely would have taken me more time to continue with my original code as the issues kept becoming more difficult as the functionality of the calculator was increasing. 

-- What would you do differently?

  -If I did the project again, I would refresh myself on array and object methods first just to keep these in the front of mind. This is so that these topics don't feel as 'alien' and I can be more confident in trying to tackle the proble by using these data types, which will most likely help me in the long run. 
-I would also spend more time at the beginning trying to 'map out' what components/areas of the calculator may be needed and try to hypothesise a couple of ways that these components could potentially work with each other to make the calculator work as a whole. 


-Instead I tried to follow the lesson steps a bit too directly, and so when it came to 'make the calculator work' section I felt a bit lost because the previous steps were so direct, so this was a big step. Instead, if I spent some time drawing things out and mapping some ideas, just to become a bit more familiar with how a calculator could actually work, this would hopefully help when it came to coding. This is in line with previous reflections of thinking about the project first. Though I think I have done this more than in the previous one, there is still room for improvement. 


-I would be tempted to make a 'dummy' smaller version of the calculator first, just to plan out how these components could work together and to see if these hypotheses actually work, rather than getting really far in the project with potentially ineffective methods and then having to start things completely from scratch again. 



-- How will you change the way you approach things?

-I will spend more time tplanning out my steps and approach first, before starting coding. 

-I would also like to make a sample/dummy prototype of the project first, just to test out some ideas, before going straight into the main project. This should help with planning and scaling any functions/logic. 

-I would like to be more refreshed and have some more practice on using arrays/objects in real life examples, to further understand some use cases and how helpful they can be.
